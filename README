libhook is a simple hook system for C.
======================================

Introduction
------------

To use it, you only need to remember two function names: hook_register and
hook_invoke.

Registering a hook is as simple as saying "Hello":

  hook_register("hook name", "callback 1", callback1);

This mean “Hey, register my callback function "callback1()" named "callback 1"
to hook "hook name"”.
If you want to register another callback for the same hook, same thing:

  hook_register("hook name", "callback 2", callback2);

Now you have two callbacks for this hook ("hook name"), you can invoke it:

  hook_invoke("hook name", NULL);

Callback functions will be called in the order they have been registered.
Pretty simple, isn't it? (more documentation can be found at the end of this
document)

Installation
------------

libhook requires two external libraries:
- lll: https://github.com/jajm/lll
- libgends: https://github.com/jajm/libgends
Please install them before installing libhook.

To install, just cd into libhook directory and run
  make
  make install # you may need root privileges for this

You can configure the install location by editing config.mk (PREFIX)


Documentation
=============

Return values
-------------

Callback functions may have return values. They can be retrieved through the
second parameter of hook_invoke.

  gds_slist_node_t *return_values = NULL;
  hook_invoke("hook name", &return_values);
  /* return_values is a list. To iterate over it, see libgends documentation */

If second parameter of hook_invoke is NULL, return values are simply ignored.

Callback function parameters
----------------------------

To pass parameters to callback functions, just pass it to hook_invoke.

  hook_invoke("hook name", NULL, param1, param2);

This is equivalent to

  callback1(param1, param2);
  callback2(param1, param2);

Note that if callback functions takes more parameters than the number of
parameters passed to hook_invoke, the extra parameters values are undefined.

libhook logs
------------

By default, libhook verbosity is 0. It means that it prints nothing.
To increase verbosity change the value of env variable LIBHOOK_VERBOSITY.
Verbosity levels are:
- 1: error
- 2: warning
- 3: info
- 4: debug
Each level include lower levels.
